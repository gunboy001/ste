# ste simple terminal editor
ste is a simple terminal editor partly inspired by micro features include
	-simple commands (ctrl-s to save)
	-light on resources
	-easy to lookaround the code
ste is written purely in C using ncurses and the gperftools' tcmalloc which makes things way faster given the amount of malloc calls required.
also do what the fuck you want with it.
